# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
  Version control is a process or system in which another program saved multiple instances of a file or program. This keeps multiple version of the program saved as the program progresses in development. This is useful because it allows a programmer to roll-back to a previous version in case there was a code breaking bug or some other major error.
* What is a branch and why would you use one?
  Branching refers to creating a parallel copy of the main(master branch) file in other to implement changes or work with different people on different features. This reduces the margin of error since the new code in the branch can be reviewed before it is merged with the main branch.
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
  a commit is a final recording of the changes that were made to a file in a repo. A good commit message will state what change was made and to which file.
* What is a merge conflict?
  a merge conflict refers to an error that happens when there is a redundant piece of code when merging two version, or when a multiple pieces of code are trying to occupy the same space. The error will be pointed out in the text editor allowing the programmer to correct or resolve the conflict in order to be able to commit.
