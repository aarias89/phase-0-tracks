-What is the purpose of HTML5 semantic tags? Which ones do you see as most useful?

The purpose of the semantic tags are to tell the browser and developers of the content of within the tag. I found the article tag the most useful because it showed the importance of organization of a page and its contents when it comes to aiding supportive/accessibility software.

What is the order the browser uses to display elements on a page?

browsers reads content in a page from top to bottom.Therefore, it will displays elements in the order they were read.

What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date?

I learned the importance of  snippets when it comes to writing code, I think i will be needed to write my own snippets down the line once I see what im typing frequently.

What concept in this challenge was most difficult for you? How can you improve your understanding of this concept?

The hardest thing in this challenge was the hierarchy of importance between the semantic tags, the only way i can improve is by writing my own code and page, then testing the results.
