Release 2: Find a Real-Life Algorithm.

When I worked in a mental health facility we had a series of steps when admitting new clients that could be translated into an algorithm.

-take information
  -potential client gave basic information
    -Chief complaint
    -demographics
    -type of program of interest
    -insurance
-If client was appropriate, meaning we could provide the recommended level of care of their chief complaint, we opened a file using their demographics.
  -if client needed higher level or care or was not appropriate for the level of care the facility provided the client was referred out.
-We made sure the wait time for their desired level of care was not out of the ordinary, if wait time was too long, client would be referred out.
- if client was appropriate and desired program type was available, we would check insurance coverage and schedule admittance day.
