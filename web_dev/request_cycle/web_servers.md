##release 1
> Linux OS is a open source operating system that helps bridge the gap across platforms. For this reason it is mostly used via the console. This system is not as suer friendly as other operating systems so some tech know-how is required.

> A VPS or Virtual Private Server is a private system that is stored remotely. VPS allows users to access the server from anywhere in the world.

>The problem with using the Linux os as a root user is that a root user has all privileges, so for security reasons one has to make an additional user with moderated permissions in order to keep the server secure.
