##How often should you stop and test what you just learned?

After every new concept is learned, one has to take a  5-10 min break and then test what was learned in order to help commit it to memory.

Breaks are important when learning a large chunk of new information. This helps with keeping stress at bay and allowing the brain to let the information sink in.
